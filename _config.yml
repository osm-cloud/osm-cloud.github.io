about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    저는 Python, AWS, Terraform, C를 주로 사용하며 AWS를 활용한 백엔드 플랫폼 인프라 구축에 집중해 왔습니다. <br> 
    쉽고 빠르게 인프라를 생성해야 한다는 생각에 Terraform과 AWS CloudFormation을 활용해 MySQL 서버를 운영하고, GitHub Actions를 사용해 자동화된 인프라를 운영한 경험이 있습니다. <br>
    시스템 관리뿐만 아니라 소프트웨어 및 웹 애플리케이션을 만드는 데에도 익숙합니다.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
